#### Решение #1 (Python)
```python
A = [i for i in range(100)]

def f(x, A):
	P = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
	Q = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]
	return ((x in A) <= (x in P)) and ((x in Q) <= (x not in A))

for i in range(100):
	if not f(i, A):
		A.remove(i)

print(len(A))
```
**Ответ:** 8.
