#### Решение #1 (Python)
```python
A = []

def f(x, A):
	P = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
	Q = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]
	R = [12, 24, 36, 48, 60]
	return (x not in A) <= (((x in P) and (x in Q)) <= (x in R))

for i in range(100):
	if not f(i, A):
		A.append(i)

m = 1
for i in A: m *= i

print(m)
```
**Ответ:** 108.
